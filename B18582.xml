            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Full documentation of the original data capture process is available from the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.
   All versions of the texts are now archived and freely available for download. See <ref target="https://textcreationpartnership.org/faq/#faq05">the TCP Download FAQ</ref>
   for detailed information. The TEI P5 versions are also freely available from the <ref target="https://github.com/textcreationpartnership">TCP Github repository</ref>.</p>

            <head>CASE Of Her Grace the Dutchess of <hi>Cleaveland,</hi> the Dukes of <hi>Grafton</hi> and <hi>Northumberland,</hi> touching an Annuity of <hi>4700 l. per annum,</hi> payable out of the <hi>Post-Office.</hi> Offered to the Consideration of the Honourable House of Commons, in relation to a Clause in a Bill, intituled a Bill for laying several Duties on low Wines, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
            </head>
            <p>BY Act of Parliament made in the 15 <hi>Car.</hi> 2. <hi>cap.</hi> 14. the Post-Office was settled upon the Duke of <hi>York</hi> and the Heirs Males of his Body.</p>
            <p>And in the same Act there is an express Provision made, that no part of the profits of the said Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice shall be paid into the Exchequer, but to the Duke or his Receiver General, with power in his own Name to Sue for the same: And in the same Act there is a power granted to His Majesty King <hi>Charles</hi> the Second, to charge the same with any Summ, not exceeding 5382 <hi>l.</hi> 10 <hi>s.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The Duke of <hi>York</hi> having Issue male, and inheritable to the said Estate, by Indenture bearing date the 26 day of <hi>January</hi> 20 <hi>Car.</hi> 2. and inrolled in <hi>Chancery,</hi> does grant and confirm unto King <hi>Charles</hi> the Second, his Heirs and Successors, the said Summ of 5382 <hi>l.</hi> 10 <hi>s.</hi> to have and enjoy the same to his Heirs and Successors for ever.</p>
            <p>Afterward King <hi>Charles</hi> the Second, by his Letters Patents dated the 19 of <hi>January</hi> following, reciting as above, grants to my Lord Viscount <hi>Grandison</hi> and Sir <hi>Edward Villars,</hi> and their Heirs 4700 <hi>l. per annum,</hi> part of the said 5328 <hi>l.</hi> 10 <hi>s.</hi> to be paid them quarterly, the same to be paid them without any Warrant or Authority from the King, his Heirs or Successors; and the Acquittances of the said Viscount <hi>Grandison</hi> and Sir <hi>Edward Villers</hi>
               <gap reason="illegible" resp="#murp" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>hould be a sufficient Discharge, as well to the Duke and all others, as also to the King, his Heirs and Succes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sors.</p>
            <p>Which said last mentioned Grant was declared by the said Viscount <hi>Grandison</hi> and Sir <hi>Edward Villars,</hi> by In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>denture dated the 26 <hi>Feb.</hi> 21 <hi>Car.</hi> 2. to be in Trust for the now Dutchess of <hi>Cleveland.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Afterwards, by Act of Parliament 22. and 23. <hi>Car.</hi> 2. <hi>num.</hi> 14. reciting the former Act of 15. <hi>Car.</hi> 2. <hi>cap.</hi> 14. and that the said Summ of 5382 <hi>l.</hi> to 10 <hi>s.</hi> was intended to be charged annually, and to be accordingly paid, tho' not so expressed n the Act; and also that some doubt might arise, whether the same Charge may remain a continuing Charge; and whether any Disposition, Grant, or Assignment thereof, or any part thereof, heretofore made by His Majesty, can or may be good and effectual in Law against the said Duke of <hi>York,</hi> and the Heirs Males of his Body, during the said Estate-tail, by reason of the doubtful Penning of the said Act; it was thereby declared and enacted, that the said Summ of 5382 <hi>l.</hi> 10 <hi>s.</hi> and the power given to His Majesty, for charging of the same, is, and at the said time of the Act was intended, and so for ever then after should be taken, a power of charging the Profits of the said Office, with the annual and perpetual Payment of 5382 <hi>l.</hi> 10 <hi>s.</hi> a Year.</p>
            <p>And in the same Act it is expresly provided, That all former Grants, Dispositions and Assignments thereof, or of any part thereof, shall be good and effectual in Law. And farther, That such Grants, Dispositions or Assignments thereof, or of any part thereof, shall be held and enjoyed, according to the tenor, effect and purport of the same, any doubt or question made or to be made upon the Penning of the said former Act to the contrary notwithstanding.</p>
            <p>That since the passing the late Act, the Dutchess did in the late King <hi>James</hi>'s time, by Conveyance settle the said Rent-Charge to her self for Life; the Remainder, as to one Moiety, to the Duke of <hi>Grafton,</hi> and the Heirs Males of his Body; and the other Moiety to the Duke of <hi>Northumberland,</hi> and the Heirs Males of his Body; and for want of Issue, the Dutchess has settled the Reversion in the Crown.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Wherefore it is humbly hoped, that a Property so secured by Letters Patents, and confirm'd by divers Acts of Parliament, shall not be divested or prejudiced; but that the several Rights of the said Dutchess and Dukes, shall be respectively secured unto them, by some Proviso to be inserted into the said Bill, or otherwise as the Justice of this Honourable House shall direct.</hi>
